# Migration Tool

This migration tool should support the migration process between versions of applications.
With the migration tool steps that are based of bash scripts can be defined and orchestrated. 

# Usage

The documentation of the Available commands and flags can be found [here](docs/cli/migration-tool.md).

## Run with Docker
```bash
docker run -v ./examples/migrations:/migrations -v ./output:/output ghcr.io/christophbe/migration-tool:latest run --folder ./migrations --execution-filename ./output/execution-log.yaml 
```

## Migrations File

The `migrations.yaml` file should be structured as follows:
```yaml
migrations:
  - filename: 001_first_step.sh
    description: |
      Execute step one of the migrations.
    hash: <auto-generated>
  - filename: 002_second_step.sh
    description: |
      Execute step two of the migrations.
    hash: <auto-generated>
```
